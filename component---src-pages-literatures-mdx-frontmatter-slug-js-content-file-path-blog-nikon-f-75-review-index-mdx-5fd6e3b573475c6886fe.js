But this happens to virtually all discontinued cameras, and as a mid-high level film camera, this SLR is considered quite affordable."),"\n",i.createElement(t.p,null,"This camera is generously equipped with features.

However, I found that to not be of much problem, for the photographic style I was using. I initially had a problem with the viewfinder. The result looked blurred to my right eye (myopic ~1.75-2.00). I had to use glasses, which prevented my eye to fully take a look through the camera. But later on, I figured out it has an 'internal pair of adjustable glasses'. The slightly hidden dial in the side of the viewfinder window allows lowly-myopic people to compensate their focused view."),"\n",i.createElement(t.p,null,"I have also tried their Multiple Exposure program. This program works pretty well it seems, but I can't say much this time, since I was not familiar with the technique at that time and I haven't tried again since. This camera supports multiple exposure by not rolling the film after an exposure. Hence, you may take an infinite amount of exposures on a single film, even between power offs. This will be a good walkaround for super long exposure shots, considering the shutter can only open 30 seconds at it's longest."),"\n",i.createElement(t.p,null,"The design is pretty dope. It has the modern plastic touch to it, elegantly executed. It's 2023 and this camera still looks like it could be placed inside camera shops' display, without raising much suspicions.

That means, had the camera happen to runned out of power during your regular photo session, you would've had to depend on fresh cells you hopefully have kept around. Unfortunately, the type of battery this camera is compatible with, isn't a good one. Here comes the second problem with this camera."),"\n",i.createElement(t.p,null,"The camera runs from a pair of CR2 cell type, which isn't that uncommon. However, it's quite obsolete by the modern standard. In addition, considering it be non rechargeable (there exist some lower qualities who are), this is a massive disadvantage. And with the current price of around 50000 rupiah per unit, two units required for this camera to operate for around four rolls, this considerably pushes the cost of taking film pictures even further. It serves as a wise self-reminder for the future, that battery-dependent film cameras are to be avoided at all cost, especially if they exclusively call for some types of single-use, obsolete cells."),"\n",i.createElement(t.p,null,"A good thing to try would be making a battery socket compatible plug, that delivers the same voltage with same or more current, that has a USB port for recharge."),"\n",i.createElement(t.p,null,"The other disadvantage is it's, supposedly, problematic LCD display. The LCD seems to be nonfunctioning in my camera, I've brought it to my local service to no avail. After lurking around online marketplaces for some 'for parts' cameras, I found out that some of Nikon F75s over the internet suffer from the exact same issue. I came to the conclusion that this is a typical problem with cameras of this type, thus adding up to the list of downsides this camera has."),"\n",i.createElement(t.p,null,"Luckily, as a camera in the transition between fully mechanical and newly electronic one, the LCD panel serves as a mere addition, rather than a complementary feature.

I am keen to try it out, bringin this camera back to it's full capabilities, but I have to wait for another camera first."),"\n",i.createElement(t.p,null,"Another 'meh' moment is how bulky and heavy this camera is, considering it's made out of plastic. It's an SLR, and my hands are small, but I've hold metal body SLRs that are at least smaller in size with no functionalities compromises."),"\n",i.createElement(t.p,null,"In general I would give this camera a solid 7, or 7.5 at best. Most of the problem was in it's battery dependency. Other than that? A slick design, decent material, more than 20 years later and it still gets mistaken for a DSLR. It wasn't an outstanding experience per se, but it gets most of the jobs done, clean.
