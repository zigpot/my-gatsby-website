I had to use glasses, which prevented my eye to fully take a look through the camera. But later on, I figured out it has an 'internal pair of adjustable glasses'.

This program works pretty well it seems, but I can't say much this time, since I was not familiar with the technique at that time and I haven't tried again since.

Here comes the second problem with this camera.\"), \"\\n\", React.createElement(_components.p, null, \"The camera runs from a pair of CR2 cell type, which isn't that uncommon. However, it's quite obsolete by the modern standard. In addition, considering it be non rechargeable (there exist some lower qualities who are), this is a massive disadvantage. And with the current price of around 50000 rupiah per unit, two units required for this camera to operate for around four rolls, this considerably pushes the cost of taking film pictures even further.

The LCD seems to be nonfunctioning in my camera, I've brought it to my local service to no avail. After lurking around online marketplaces for some 'for parts' cameras, I found out that some of Nikon F75s over the internet suffer from the exact same issue. I came to the conclusion that this is a typical problem with cameras of this type, thus adding up to the list of downsides this camera has.\"), \"\\n\", React.createElement(_components.p, null, \"Luckily, as a camera in the transition between fully mechanical and newly electronic one, the LCD panel serves as a mere addition, rather than a complementary feature.

I am keen to try it out, bringin this camera back to it's full capabilities, but I have to wait for another camera first.\"), \"\\n\", React.createElement(_components.p, null, \"Another 'meh' moment is how bulky and heavy this camera is, considering it's made out of plastic.

Most of the problem was in it's battery dependency. Other than that? A slick design, decent material, more than 20 years later and it still gets mistaken for a DSLR.
