To multitask is to do two or more jobs simultaneously, in an attempt to get more things done within a period of time. Modern day capitalism has not only created a system that demands efficient skills, it has single-handedly gaslighted society into becoming more productive. Human aren’t like computer however. True multitasking, which means splitting the attention towards multiple different task at the same time, is practically an act impossible to perform. The ‘multitasking’ a typical person do is switching between tasks. This gives on a larger time frame the illusion of actual multitasking.
